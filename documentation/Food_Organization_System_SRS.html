                <p>
                    The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the requirements,
                    features, and
                    functionality of the Food Organization System (FOS) web application to ensure that it meets the
                    needs of its
                    users, including individuals tracking their diets, chefs, nutritionists, and restaurant owners.

                <p>
                    The FOS web application will provide users with the ability to create, update, and manage custom
                    shopping
                    and
                    food lists, track pantry inventory and expiration dates, and access a public marketplace of food
                    lists. The
                    application will utilize the OpenFoodFacts public API for retrieving product information and offer
                    user
                    account
                    management features.

                    <p>
                        The FOS web application will be built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The
                        tech
                        stack
                        will
                        include the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frontend: SASS, TypeScript, HTML5</li>
                        <li>Backend: Node.js with TypeScript, non-relational databases</li>
                        <li>API: OpenFoodFacts</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h4>2.5.2 Rationale</h4>
                    <p>
                        The MVC architecture is chosen for its modularity, separation of concerns, and ease of
                        maintenance,
                        which
                        will
                        facilitate future development and updates. The tech stack is selected based on its modern,
                        efficient, and
                        widely-supported nature, ensuring compatibility, performance, and maintainability.
