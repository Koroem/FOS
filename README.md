# FOS (Food Organization System)

FOS is a web application that will provide users the ability to create, update, and manage custom
                    shopping
                    and
                    food lists, track pantry inventory and expiration dates, and access a public marketplace of food
                    lists. The
                    application will utilize the OpenFoodFacts public API for retrieving product information and offer
                    user
                    account
                    management features.
